# Wall-IT Deletion Behavior Update 🗑️

Wall-IT now uses **permanent deletion** instead of creating backup folders when removing wallpapers from your collection.

## 🔄 **What Changed:**

### Before:
- ❌ Removed wallpapers were moved to `~/Pictures/Removed-Wallpapers/`
- ❌ Created unnecessary backup folder
- ❌ Wasted disk space
- ❌ Required manual cleanup

### After:
- ✅ Wallpapers are permanently deleted when removed
- ✅ No backup folders created
- ✅ Clean and simple deletion
- ✅ Frees up disk space immediately

## ⚠️ **Important:**

**Removed wallpapers are now permanently deleted!** Make sure you have backups elsewhere if you want to keep copies.

## 🛠 **Updated Dialog:**

The removal dialog now shows:
```
Remove 'wallpaper.jpg' from wallpaper collection?

⚠️ This will permanently delete the file.

[Cancel] [Remove]
```

## 🧹 **Cleanup Tools:**

If you have an existing `~/Pictures/Removed-Wallpapers/` folder from before this update, you can handle it with:

```bash
# Interactive cleanup (recommended)
wall-it-cleanup-removed

# Or use the integrated cleanup
wall-it-keybinds cleanup
```

### Cleanup Options:
1. **Restore** - Move all wallpapers back to your collection
2. **Delete** - Permanently delete the backup folder and contents
3. **Keep** - Leave folder as-is (Wall-IT won't create it anymore)

## 🎯 **Benefits:**

- **Cleaner filesystem** - No accumulating backup folders
- **Immediate space recovery** - Disk space freed right away
- **Simpler workflow** - Remove means remove, not archive
- **Less maintenance** - No need to clean up backup folders

## 📝 **How to Use:**

1. **In Wall-IT GUI:**
   - Select wallpaper in grid view
   - Press `Delete` key or right-click → Remove
   - Confirm deletion in dialog

2. **Keyboard Shortcut:**
   - Select wallpaper
   - Press `Delete` key
   - Confirm when prompted

## 🔒 **Safety:**

- **Confirmation required** - You must confirm each deletion
- **Clear warning** - Dialog clearly states permanent deletion
- **Only from collection** - Only affects wallpapers in `~/Pictures/Wallpapers/`

## 🏗️ **Technical Details:**

**Old Implementation:**
```python
# Moved files to backup folder
shutil.move(wallpaper_path, backup_folder)
```

**New Implementation:**
```python
# Permanent deletion
wallpaper_path.unlink()
```

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/DiscoNiri/.local/bin/wallpaper-gui.py` - Updated deletion behavior
- `/home/DiscoNiri/.local/bin/wall-it-cleanup-removed` - Cleanup tool for existing backups

**This change makes Wall-IT more efficient and user-friendly by eliminating unnecessary backup folder management!** 🎉
